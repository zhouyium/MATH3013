# ComplexNumber
We will teach you to release a complex number in C++ step by step

## Step 1
In this project, I will finish a basic complex number.

We can output the value of a complex number.

## Step 2
In this project, We will implement the operator=.

So we can ressign a complex value using the operator=.

## Step 3
In this project, We will implement the operator+.

Now we can finish complex number a+b problem.
